# Vdlp.SecurityTxt

“When security risks in web services are discovered by independent security researchers who understand the severity of 
the risk, they often lack the channels to disclose them properly. As a result, security issues may be left unreported. 
`security.txt` defines a standard to help organizations define the process for security researchers to disclose security 
vulnerabilities securely.”
